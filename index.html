<h1 class="text-center">Chaos Fundamentum</h1>

<p><em>Chaos Fundamentum</em> is a modular, responsive frontend-framework, that is heavily inspired by other frameworks, such as Twitter Bootstrap. However it does provide it's own set of functionality, carefully hand-crafted and as minimal as possible, putting the developer (or designer) and his wishes first.</p>

<p>The framework is intended to work with the following browsers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 10+</li>
  <li>Firefox 24+</li>
  <li>Chrome 21+</li>
  <li>Safari 5.1+</li>
  <li>Opera 12.1+</li>
  <li>iOS Safari 5.1+</li>
  <li>Android Browser 4+</li>
</ul>

<p>Please keep in mind, that it uses the most modern standard and such isn't viewable by approximately 25 % of the users out there (see <cite><a href="http://caniuse.com/usage_table.php">"Can I use" usage table</a></cite>).</p>

<p>The following site showcases the usage of the framework and provides a few examples. Please begin by exploring the site with the menu above.
