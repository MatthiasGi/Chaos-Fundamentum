<h1 id="normalize-scss-v2">normalize.scss v2</h1>
<p>Normalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.</p>
<p>Normalize.scss takes this to the next level: Allowing basic customisation for
most aspects to keep the already little normalize.css as little as really
needed. Please head over to the
<a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">original project page</a> for more
details. Don&#39;t forget that this needs <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>! For a pure
CSS version head down to the above mentioned project page of normalize.css.</p>
